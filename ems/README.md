# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a simple console-based Java application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and the ArrayList collection. It provides basic CRUD functionality for managing employee data. The system is designed to allow easy management of employee details such as name, ID, designation, and salary.
## CRUD Operations

- C - Create / Insert
- R - Read / Reterive
- U - Update / Modify

## Features

- Add Employee : Create and add a new employee record with details like employee ID, name, designation, and salary.
- View Employees: Display a list of all employees with their respective details.
- Update Employee: Modify the details of an existing employee.
- Delete Employee: Remove an employee record from the system.
- Search Employee: Find a specific employee by ID.

## Technologies Used

- Java: The core programming language used to build the system.
- ArrayList: To store and manage employee data dynamically.
- OOP Concepts: Encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance are used to structure the application.
- Scanner: For user input handling.
## Future Enhancements

- Adding file handling to store employee data persistently.
- Adding more robust validation for inputs.
- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
## How to Run

- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Clone or download the source code.
- Compile the Java files using the command:
  
    javac Main.java
- Run the application with:

    java Main
